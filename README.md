# DSA-DATA-ANALYSIS-CAPSTONE-PROJECT-AMAZON
## My DSA Capstone project dashboard on Amazon company is here.

I am working as a Junior Data Analyst at RetailTech Insights, a company that provides e-commerce analytics solutions to sellers on platforms like Amazon. My team has been tasked with analysing product and customer review data to generate insights that can 'guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

### Analysis Tasks

4. Which products have the highest average ratings? 
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category? 
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews? 
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more? 
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)? 
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category? 
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200, ₹200–₹500, >₹500)? 
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount? 
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews? 
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
